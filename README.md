# Arduino-Emotional-Sensor
It is an Internet of things(IoT) based project having the main component as Arduino UNO Revision3 board, which acts as a microcontroller on ATmega328P (datasheet). It acts as an emotional sensor, as the emotions of a person change its body temperature varies on to that, so a sound is produced for neutralize the mood as well as emotion to make the person calm in all emotions. For Example: If a person is in anger, his body temperature is between 37-39 degree Celsius so the red colour light will glow on multi-colour led ana a song is played.
